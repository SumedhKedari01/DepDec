            <h3>2. Build a Support Network</h3>
            <p>Surround yourself with supportive friends and family members who can offer encouragement and understanding. Joining support groups can also be beneficial, as they provide a sense of community and shared experience.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Practice Self-Care</h3>
            <p>Engage in activities that promote well-being and relaxation, such as exercise, hobbies, and mindfulness practices like meditation and yoga. Maintaining a regular sleep schedule and eating a balanced diet also play a crucial role in managing depression.</p>

            <h3>4. Set Realistic Goals</h3>
            <p>Break down tasks into smaller, manageable steps and set achievable goals. This can help prevent feeling overwhelmed and can provide a sense of accomplishment.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Avoid Substance Abuse</h3>
            <p>Steer clear of alcohol and drugs, as they can exacerbate depression symptoms and interfere with treatment.</p>
            
            <h3>6. Stay Connected</h3>
            <p>Maintain social connections, even if it's through phone calls or online interactions. Isolation can worsen depression, so staying connected with others is important.</p>
            
            <h3>7. Be Patient with Yourself</h3>
            <p>Recovery from depression takes time, and setbacks may occur. Be patient and kind to yourself during this process, and celebrate small victories along the way.</p>
